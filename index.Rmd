### This webpage also contains plots used in clinical trials.

There are two plots in this webpage. The first one is spider plot, and the second one is waterfall plot. Both plots can be used to detect the change of objects, such as tumor size percent change. 
In the spider plot, x axis represents time, and y axis represents the percent change of tumor size. In the waterfall plot, x axis represents name (id), and y axis represents the maximum percent change of tumor size.
